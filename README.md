# System Design Overview

The solution consists of two services: the Freelancer Service and the Notification Service. These services communicate asynchronously using RabbitMQ as the message broker.

## Freelancer Service

The Freelancer Service is responsible for managing freelancer information, including storing and retrieving data from an H2 database. It also functions as a producer in the messaging system.
- Database (H2): Used to store and manage freelancer records.
- Producer Role: Whenever freelancer information is updated (e.g., new entries, updates to existing records), the service publishes messages containing the updated data to a RabbitMQ queue, which is consumed by the Notification Service.
- Security Configuration: Implemented a simple security setup using in-memory users for authentication and authorization. Freelancer service is used by freelancer users (users with role FREELANCER, login/password user/user) and staff users (users with role STAFF, login/password admin/admin).

## Notification Service

The Notification Service acts as a consumer, retrieving messages from the RabbitMQ queue and handling notifications accordingly.

 - Consumer Role: The service listens to the RabbitMQ queue. When a message containing updated freelancer information is received, it processes the message and stores the relevant data in its own H2 database for further use.
 - Database (H2): Used to store notification-related data or any processed information received from the Freelancer Service.
